## 04-Writing good tests

-   Dont test third party APIs
-   Dont test your server side code implicitly via your client side code. Write separate tests for your backend code instead.
-   DO Test your client-side reaction to different responses and errors.
-   Follow AAA Arrange-Act-Assert.
-   Only test one thing in a single test.
-   Focus on the essence of test when arranging.
-   Keep your number of assertions (expect statements) as low as possible.
