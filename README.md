## Installation

1. create a new project with `npm init -y`
2. run the command `npm install --save-dev vitest`
3. replace the test script in package.json with `vitest --globals`. The --globals flag will ensure you can use `it` and `expect` assertions without any extra imports.
4. Download or clone the pre-configured Github repositries in local.
5. Run `npm install` in each of the sub-folders to install the dependencies
6. For **basic-testing-frontend** project, run `npm start` and in the browser `localhost:8080` to open the project. This is a frontend app.
7. For **basic-testing-nodejs** project, run the `node app.js` command and in the browser `localhost:3000` to open the project. This is an expressjs app using traditional modules export.
8. **basic-testing-nodejs-esmodules** makes use of the ES6 modules and import statements. Installation and running the app procedure is similiar to the nodejs app.
